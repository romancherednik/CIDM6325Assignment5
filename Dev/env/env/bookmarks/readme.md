##Assignment 5
##Chapter 4-5 notes

##Some issues from Chapter 4 - I would have syntax errors regarding indentation. Specifically there is an issue
##with file views.py however I'm not exactly sure how to fix it (even though I spent a couple hours looking into
##the issue on what it could possibly be to get it running. I am able to runserver just not able to access some
##pages. The authentication with this chapter is incredibly interesting to me because I thought there would be so much
##work to include authentication from facebook/twitter/google etc whereas when running through the code, this seemed
##pretty painless.

##Some issues from Chapter 5 - so far no issues when running code and editing files. There are no struggles either so
##far, which is surprising as I've hit some bumps in chapter 4. Despite not running into issues when changing files
##and writing code, this chapter seems actually pretty complex in terms of coding as we are now dealing with Ajax
##Jquerys, content from other website, users posting likes ,etc.
